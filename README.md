# code_refactoring_accessibility

## Description

This assignment was to take a particular website, refactor the code, and also make it accessible.  I made changes to some of the old semantics from html4 to updated html5.  I also condensed a lot of the classes and/or ids. While doing that rearranging css to match all the condensing or changes.  I also reordered the css so the content was easier to follow, and included comments to help guide through the page.  I attempted to future proof most of the code.  So that if the owners want to add additional content in any area of the site it is ready.
